## Improvements to make

1. Tf function usage
2. Tensorboard activation checks (prevent explosion, vanishing)
3. Improve weight inits, random seed checks
4. Reward changes - waiting times
5. Scaling rewards: Normalize rewards within each batch using the mean and standard deviation of that batch.
6. One hot encode phases in input
7. Experiment with GNN, Double DQN, dueling DQN
8. Reward smoothing: moving average usage
9. Try soft network updates
10.
